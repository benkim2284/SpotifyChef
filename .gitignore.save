remote:  !     Error: Couldn't find any supported Python package manager files.
remote:  !     
remote:  !     A Python app on Heroku must have either a 'requirements.txt',
remote:  !     'Pipfile' or 'poetry.lock' package manager file in the root
remote:  !     directory of its source code.
remote:  !     
remote:  !     Currently the root directory of your app contains:
remote:  !     
remote:  !     db.sqlite3
remote:  !     ListeningHistory.html
remote:  !     MainPageMenu.html
remote:  !     manage.py
remote:  !     SpotifyChef/
remote:  !     SpotifyWrappedApp/
remote:  !     
remote:  !     If your app already has a package manager file, check that it:
remote:  !     
remote:  !     1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
remote:  !     2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
remote:  !     3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
remote:  !     
remote:  !     Otherwise, add a package manager file to your app. If your app has
remote:  !     no dependencies, then create an empty 'requirements.txt' file.
